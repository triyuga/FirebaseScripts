# Firebase Scripts

Scripts to demonstrate firebase functionality, in a minimal style.

Running the scripts will cause the /sandbox directory to be created, as the firebase working directory.
The /sandbox directory is gitignored, and can be deleted and recreated by running the scripts.
The purpose is to demonstrate a repeatable process to setup and deploy a firebase project from scratch, via the command line.

## Create and deploy React app to Firebase

## Create and deploy Functions to Firebase
